# Changelog

## 0.8.2 (2026-03-04) — Cerberus Review Fixes (Complete)
- fix: **Self-approval prevention** — agents cannot approve their own pending requests
- fix: **Approver allowlist enforced** — `config.approvers` is now checked on every `/approve` call
- fix: **Notification failure safety** — auto-deny when notification fails and `defaultAction: "allow"`
- fix: **Bounded pending queue** — `MAX_PENDING = 100` prevents unbounded Map growth
- fix: Async notifier support — handles Promise-returning notifiers
- feat: `/approve` returns structured error messages (self-approval blocked, unauthorized approver)
- tests: 834 total — added PolicyEvaluator integration tests for approve effect priority (deny>approve>allow)

## 0.8.1 (2026-03-04) — Cerberus Review Fixes
- fix: Self-approval prevention — agents cannot approve their own pending requests
- fix: Approver allowlist enforced — `config.approvers` is now checked on every `/approve` call
- **fix: Notification failure safety** — if notification delivery fails and `defaultAction: "allow"`, auto-deny immediately instead of silent auto-allow
- fix: Async notifier support — `ApprovalNotifier` now accepts `Promise<void>` return
- fix: Bounded pending queue — max 100 concurrent approvals, auto-deny on overflow
- fix: `/approve` command extracts caller identity from command context for audit trail
- tests: 831 total (was 826) — self-approval, approver allowlist, notification failure, maxPending overflow

## 0.8.0 (2026-03-04)
- feat: **RFC-009 Approval Manager — Human-in-the-Loop** for high-risk tool calls
  - New policy effect `action: "approve"` — pauses agent execution, asks human for approval
  - Async Promise-based flow — agent waits for `/approve` or `/deny` command
  - Configurable timeout with `defaultAction` (auto-allow or auto-deny on expiry)
  - Trust bypass: agents above `minTrust` score skip approval automatically
  - `/approve [id]` command — approve pending request, or list all pending without args
  - `/deny <id> [reason]` command — deny with optional reason
  - Notification system with `ApprovalNotifier` interface — pluggable notification delivery
  - Param redaction in approval notifications — secrets never shown in approval messages
  - Cleanup on gateway shutdown — all pending approvals auto-denied gracefully
  - Timer unref — approval timeouts don't prevent Node.js process exit
- tests: 826 total (was 810)

## 0.7.3 (2026-03-04)
